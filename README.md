# SVG-Chaos

## Description
In this challenge, we were supposed to implement a program whereby users can create their own hi-resolution SVG logos using prompts coded into the scripts.

The logo can be generated as a file written into the node.js via the "fs" method.

The logo can then be previewed by the user. If the user wants a different one, he/she can run the program again until the desired output is created.

## Installation
Modified JS scripts for the exercise.

Installed Inquirer 8.2.4 and implemented jest for testing.

Provided proper file structure for code and output.

Completed code pushed to GitHub.


## Usage
The end user should be able to get the desired SVG logo with text and shape by answering prompts in the CLI.
